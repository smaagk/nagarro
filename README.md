Simple coding exercise:

In JS, write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. 

For example, Smooth would become S3h.  Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.


TO TEST

Node v14.17.3
npm install
npm i jest-cli -g
jest

you can change the sentece in the test file
